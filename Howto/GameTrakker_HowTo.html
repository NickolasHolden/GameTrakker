		<h1>How To Use GameTrakker</h1>
		<h2>How To Register</h2>
		<div>

		<h2>How To Log In</h2>
		<div>

			<p>Once you have registered, you should receive a notification saying that your registration was successful.
			When you click ok on the successful notification, you should be returned to the "LogIn" screen.

		<h2>How To Enter Scores</h2>
		<div>
			<p>There are actually two different ways to enter scores on GameTrakker and we will cover both, starting with the easier way.
			<ul>
			<img src="images\MainMenu.png" alt="Main Menu" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
			<img src="images\EnterScoresEasy.png" alt="Easy Scores" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
			<li>To enter scores the easy way, click on enter scores. From there, choose the date that the game was played (The current date will be used if no date is entered).
			Next, choose the type of game being played (Private, League, or Tournament). You are also able to enter a name for your game in the next box. This is completely optional
			but it will make it easier to find when viewing your scores. Finally, enter your score for the game and click "Enter Score". A pop-up will let you know that the game has
			been successfully entered. From here, you have the option to enter more scores if you want to.
			</li>
			<img src="images\MainMenu.png" alt="Main Menu" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
			<img src="images\EnterScoresManual.png" alt="Manual Scores" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
			<li>
			The next method to enter your score is from the "Scorecard" button on the Main Menu. In the Scorecard method, you will be able to enter your scores frame by frame while
			are playing the game. Just click the box in the frame and enter the score after each turn. To proceed to the next score box when not entering a strike or spare, press the 
			Enter key. Should you get a strike, click the "Strike" button below the corresponding frame and it will enter the strike for you. The same method applies if you pick up a 
			spare on your second turn in the frame. When you are finished filling in all of the frames for the game, click the "Enter Score" button and you will get a pop-up to let 
			you know that the game has been successfully recorded.
			</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			</div>
		<h2>How To View Your Scores</h2>
		<div>
		<img src="images\MainMenu.png" alt="Main Menu" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
		<img src="images\ViewScores.png" alt="View Scores Screen" style="width:400px;height:228px;"/>
		<p>From the Main Menu, click on the view scores button. This will take you to a screen that shows your total scores from your games and overall average. Dropdown box in the
		top-right of the screen, you can switch between the game types to see the scores from those specific categories along with your average from each game type.
		</p>
		</div>
